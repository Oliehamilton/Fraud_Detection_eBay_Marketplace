# Fraud_Detection_eBay_Marketplace
Fraud Detection and Auction Outcome Prediction for eBay Marketplaces

In this project, I served as a Data Analyst at a consulting firm specialising in online marketplaces. My primary responsibility was to analyse eBay auction data to detect potential shill bidding activities and forecast auction outcomes. The project aimed to enhance eBay's auction integrity and inform business strategies through data-driven insights.

Key Responsibilities:
1.	Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
  - Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify and address missing values and outliers in the shill bidding dataset.
  - Visualized key characteristics such as Bidder Tendency, Bidding Ratio, and Auction Bids to understand their distributions and influence on auction outcomes.
  - Applied necessary data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for further analysis.
2.	Clustering and Classification:
  - Developed two classification models to predict the likelihood of a bid being normal or indicative of shill bidding.
  - Compared the models' performance based on accuracy and other metrics, selecting the best model for fraud detection.
  - Applied clustering algorithms to segment auctions based on bidding patterns, creating custom classes for deeper analysis.
  - Built a classification model using the clustering results to predict outcomes, providing insights into bidding behaviour.
3.	Regression Analysis:
  - Performed two regression analyses to predict final auction prices using relevant features identified through EDA.
  - Compared the performance of the regression models, selecting the most accurate model for predicting auction outcomes.
  - Discussed the implications of the findings for eBay's auction strategy, offering recommendations to optimize auction processes.
